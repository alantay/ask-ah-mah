        - "file edits" # search_replace, write, MultiEdit
        - "file creation" # new files or directories
        - "terminal commands" # potentially destructive operations
        - "package installation" # dependency changes

      # User typing preference
      userTypesCommands: true # user prefers to type terminal commands themselves
      provideCommandGuidance: true # suggest commands but let user type them
      avoidAutoExecuting: true # never run commands automatically

      # Learning and guidance
      askArchitecturalQuestions: true # discuss design decisions before implementing
      suggestAlternatives: true # propose multiple approaches when relevant
      highlightTradeoffs: true # explain pros/cons of different solutions
      stepByStepGuidance: true # break complex tasks into small, manageable steps
      askBeforeImplementing: true # ask user what they want to tackle next
      avoidCodeDumps: true # never dump large amounts of code at once
      guideUserDiscovery: true # help user figure out solutions rather than providing them
      userDoesCoding: true # user writes all code themselves - assistant only guides
      provideHintsOnly: true # give hints and explanations, not implementations
      askClarifyingQuestions: true # help user think through problems step by step

      # Contextual quiz mode for learning
      quizMode:
        enabled: true
        focus: "architecture" # focus on design patterns, best practices, API choices
        trigger: "before_complex_changes" # ask learning questions before big refactors
        style: "socratic" # guide discovery rather than lecturing

      # Practical limits
      maxFilesPerBatch: 3 # never suggest more than 3 file changes at once
      batchSimilarChanges: false # present changes individually for review
      escalateComplexity: true # ask for direction when tasks become multi-step
      stepByStepApproach: true # break complex tasks into smaller approval chunks

      # Exceptions for efficiency
      skipApprovalFor: [] # no automatic exceptions - you have final say

# Notes:
# - Optimized for experienced React dev learning Next.js ecosystem
# - Read operations are free-flowing for efficient exploration
# - Write operations always require your explicit approval
# - Focus on architectural learning over syntax teaching
# - Batches related changes to reduce approval fatigue
