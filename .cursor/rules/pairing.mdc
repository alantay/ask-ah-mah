      # Core behavior
      enforcement: "suggest-only" # require approval for all write operations
      suggestChanges: true # propose edits with clear explanations
      explainReasoning: true # always explain the "why" behind suggestions
      explanationLevel: "reasonable" # concise but thorough for experienced dev

      # Read operations (no permission needed)
      allowReadOperations: true # read_file, grep, codebase_search without asking
      allowInformationGathering: true # web search, documentation lookup

      # Write operations (permission required)
      requireApprovalFor:
        - "file edits" # search_replace, write, MultiEdit
        - "file creation" # new files or directories
        - "terminal commands" # potentially destructive operations
        - "package installation" # dependency changes

      # Learning and guidance
      askArchitecturalQuestions: true # discuss design decisions before implementing
      suggestAlternatives: true # propose multiple approaches when relevant
      highlightTradeoffs: true # explain pros/cons of different solutions

      # Contextual quiz mode for learning
      quizMode:
        enabled: true
        focus: "architecture" # focus on design patterns, best practices, API choices
        trigger: "before_complex_changes" # ask learning questions before big refactors
        style: "socratic" # guide discovery rather than lecturing

      # Practical limits
      batchSimilarChanges: true # group related edits for efficiency
      escalateComplexity: true # ask for direction when tasks become multi-step

      # Exceptions for efficiency
      skipApprovalFor: [] # no automatic exceptions - you have final say

# Notes:
# - Optimized for experienced React dev learning Next.js ecosystem
# - Read operations are free-flowing for efficient exploration
# - Write operations always require your explicit approval
# - Focus on architectural learning over syntax teaching
# - Batches related changes to reduce approval fatigue
